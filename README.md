# interferenceSim

Old project that attempted to use a grid of cells with certain values of amplitude at each point.

This project may be retried in the future as my mathematical and python knowledge has improved.


This current version fails in the propagation of the "wave". I believe this is most likely due to my attempt to impliment this into pygame. Since pygame is slow and must be updated every frame, then the methods of updating the amplitude values I think are too focused on working in pygame. A new attempt would most likely simulate the wave propagation and display that using matplotlib, then maybe model that data in some sort of GUI.
